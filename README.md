Motivation 

Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, social interaction has been greatly reduced in NUS as most lessons have transited to an online setting. The lack of physical interaction has reduced the number of opportunities to make friends and network in NUS. Lack of social interaction may lead to one feeling isolated in school and may negatively impact one’s mental health. Social interaction is often overlooked but plays a crucial role in shaping a vibrant NUS life. Friends act as a pillar of support to help one through difficult times. Networking allows one to meet new people and widen one’s horizons.

Aim 

Our project aims to open up more opportunities for interaction amongst NUS students on campus.
