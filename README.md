Motivation:
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, social interaction has been greatly reduced in NUS as most lessons have transited to an online setting. The lack of physical interaction has reduced the number of opportunities to make friends and network in NUS. Social interaction is often overlooked but plays a crucial role in shaping a vibrant NUS life. Friends act as a pillar of support to help one through difficult times. Networking allows one to meet new people and widen one’s horizons. As NUS students, it is crucial to network and meet peers from similar faculties or interest groups. On the other hand, the lack of social interaction may lead to one feeling isolated in school and may negatively impact one’s mental health. Hence, we decided to create an app that allows NUS students to foster closer bonds and expand their social circle. 
 
Vision:
Our project aims to open up more opportunities for interaction among NUS students on campus, so that NUS students can experience a vibrant university life.
NUS students are able to host different activities through our app and find peers to join their activity in real time. This will essentially reduce the time needed to plan simple activities such as basketball, mahjong, study sessions etc. NUSinteract can even allow users to join activities spontaneously on campus.
